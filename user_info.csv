I love the outdoors, sports, and listening to music (more country and classic rock; I'm really into Tyler Childers and Zach Bryan at the moment, however, I can pretty much vibe with any music).

I love going out with friends to eat, joke around, and talk about random things. I ran track and xc in high school (but it doesn't mean I'm fast 😔) so I'm always down to go on runs. If someone could teach me how to use the machines or lift at the gym facility that would be nice too. I also like watching anime and listening to my Spotify K-indie/K-r&b playlists. I really love music and you can always find me annoying people with my singing. Right now though my current bop is Castaways by the Backyardigans.

I recently got a job at a boba shop but the addiction started long before (current 2021 boba count is already 100+), so I will very likely tag along if you get boba.
