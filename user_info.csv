"Hi, I’m Vivek! I’m from the SF Bay Area, and am majoring in Data Science (and possibly pursuing a CS dual degree) at Purdue!

I enjoy watching TV - I’m currently watching Rick and Morty, though my favs are prolly Cobra Kai, Schitt’s Creek, Parks and Rec, and Breaking Bad! I also love music, but my music taste is all over the place — I absolutely adore Taylor Swift, Lorde, Ben Platt, Phoebe Bridgers, and Childish Gambino!

I’m definitely shy when I first meet you, but I’ll open up pretty quickly! I’d probably learn towards staying in on weekends (bit of an introvert), but I’ll prolly be down to hit the town as well!

I’m so excited to go to Purdue this fall, and meeting all of you — feel free to hmu if you want to be friends!",2021-05-30 06:00:00,https://www.instagram.com/p/CPfHr6tlpi_,[],['vi.vekc']
