If someone could teach me how to use the machines or lift at the gym facility that would be nice too. I also like watching anime and listening to my Spotify K-indie/K-r&b playlists.

I recently got a job at a boba shop but the addiction started long before (current 2021 boba count is already 100+), so I will very likely tag along if you get boba.

post,"Hi everyone! I’m Sabrina and am committed to Purdue in Exploratory Studies! I’m hoping to CODO into Computer Science, but still want to explore my options, so that might change. I’m from Montevideo, Uruguay. So I’m basically going to be studying over 15 hs (by plane) away from home, but I’m super exited for the next four years !! 

In my free time I enjoy hanging out with friends, playing music (mostly the piano), working out, going to concerts and honestly I just like to have fun. I also enjoy nature, making art, makeup, traveling…I’m down for pretty much anything. 
I’m really sociable and I want to go out, meet new people, and just have a good time. Please feel free to reach out to me !!
